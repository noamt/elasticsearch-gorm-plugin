== Deprecation Notice

The ElasticSearch Grails plugin has a new maintainer!

Please browse to Puneet Behl fork for new updates for the plugin source code:
https://github.com/puneetbehl/elasticsearch-grails-plugin

Among the main new features of this version is the ability to use any gorm-datastore with the plugin,
so you are no longer bound to the hibernate plugin.

If you were using the **0.17.x** version of the original plugin, or one of the **0.20.x** snapshots,
you should consider upgrading to the latest version.

This repository will no longer be updated but will stay online for a while for archive purpose.

Thanks to all the contributors and users of the original plugin!

== Original Readme Below

=== Elasticsearch Grails plugin

An Elasticsearch plugin for Grails; This project is a fork based on the great work done by the guys at https://github.com/noamt/elasticsearch-grails-plugin & https://github.com/mstein/elasticsearch-grails-plugin.

=== Why would you want to fork the original Elasticsearch plugin?

The original Elasticsearch plugin relies on *Hibernate-specific* GORM components, thus rendering it unusable if you back your Grails application by any other database.

=== How can I obtain the plugin?

[NOTE]
====
The latest verion of plugin documentation can be found at http://puneetbehl.github.io/elasticsearch-grails-plugin/docs/index.html
====

Just like any other Grails plugin, through the Grails Plugin center.
Edit your project's +build.gradle+ file, by adding the plugin's dependency declaration:


----
dependencies {
    ...
    compile "org.grails.plugins:elasticsearch:2.4.0"
    ...

}

=== Ohs Nos! I'm hitting a +java.lang.Exception: No datastore implementation specified+

This error means that you probably haven't specified your datastore type in your +application.groovy+ or +application.yml+ file.
This plugin has an auto-index feature which automatically propagates any changes made to searchable Domains into the search index;
this is done by hooking into GORM's storage events but also requires a reference to the active datastore implementation.
To fix, edit your project's +application.groovy+ or +application.yml+ file and add:
application.groovy
----
elasticSearch {
    ...
    datastoreImpl = 'nameOfDatastoreBean'
    ...
}
----

application.yml
----
elasticSearch:
    datastoreImpl: nameOfDatastoreBean
----
Where the value should be the name of the datastore bean as it is configured in the Spring context; some possible values:

MongoDB::
    +mongoDatastore+
Hibernate::
    +hibernateDatastore+
