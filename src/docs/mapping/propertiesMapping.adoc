=== Properties Mapping

You can customize the mapping for each domain properties using the closure mapping.
The syntax is simple:

[source, groovy]
----
static searchable = {
    propertyName option1:value, option2:value, ...
}
----

==== Available options

[width="100%",cols="3",options="header"]
|===
| Option Name | Values | Description

| boost 
| Number 
| A decimal boost value. With a positive value, promotes search results for hits in this property; with a negative value, demotes search results that hit this property.

| <<searchableComponent, component>> 
| `true`, `false` 
| To use only on domain (or collection of domains), make the property a searchable component.

| converter 
| A `Class` 
| A `Class` to use as a converter during the marshalling/un-marshalling process for that peculiar property. That class must extends the `PropertyEditorSupport` java class.

| excludeFromAll 
| `true`, `false` 
| determines if the property is to append in the `"_all"` field. Default to `true`.

| index 
| `"no"`, `"not_analyzed"`, `"analyzed"`. 
| How or if the property is made into searchable element. One of `"no"`, `"not_analyzed"` or `"analyzed"`.

| fielddata
|  `true`, `false`
| Enables the use of text fields in sorting and aggregation. Be careful as fielddata can consume a lot of heap space, especially when loading high cardinality text fields. Default `false`

| <<searchableReference, reference>> 
| `true`, `false` 
| To use only on domain (or collection of domains), make the property a searchable reference.

| <<parentChild, parent>> 
| `true`, `false` 
| A boolean value to be used in conjunction with the `reference` or `component` property . Set to `true` if the referenced field should be mapped as the parent of this document. Default set to `false`.

| multi_field 
| `true`, `false` 
| A boolean value. Maps the value of the field twice; Once with it being analyzed, and once with it being not_analyzed under the name untouched. Default set to `false`.

| fields
| A map describing the extra fields
| Maps the value of the field more than once; it is useful when you want to index a field with different analyzers. See the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/multi-fields.html[ElasticSearch documentation]. Default set to `null`.

| <<geoPoint, geoPoint>> 
| `true`, `false` 
| Maps the field to a geo_point. Default: `false`

| <<alias, alias>> 
| String 
| A string value. The field noted with this parameter will be duplicated to an alias

| <<dynamic, dynamic>> 
| `true`, `false` 
| Only available for String properties. Determines whether this field should be dynamically mapped by elasticsearch.
