From version 0.0.4.0 in addition to the indices generated by the plugin based on the domain objects package names or configuration, two new aliases are created for every index: @<indexName>_read@ and @<indexName>_write@. These two aliases are used by the plugin to index and query from Elasticsearch and are needed to centralise the choice of index to use during mapping migrations when the @'alias'@ strategy is used and there are multiple instances of the application.
