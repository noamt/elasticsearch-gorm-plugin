To sort for geo distances, a SortBuilder must be passed to search()

h4. Example

{code:groovy}
def sortBuilder = SortBuilders.geoDistanceSort("location")
    .point(48.141, 11.57)
    .unit(DistanceUnit.KILOMETERS)
    .order(SortOrder.ASC)

def result = elasticSearchService.search(
    [indices: Building, types: Building, sort: sortBuilder],
    null as Closure,
    {
        geo_distance(
            'distance': '5km',
            'location': [lat: 48.141, lon: 11.57]
        )
    })
{code}

The calculated distances are not part of the search results themselves but are part of @result.sort@.
@sort@ contains all search values calculated by the ElasticSearch server as a list mapped to the id of the respective domain objects

{code:groovy}
assert [1:[2.34567], 2: [2.4402342]] == result.sort
{code}
