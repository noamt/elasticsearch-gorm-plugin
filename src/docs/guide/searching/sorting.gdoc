To sort the search results, either a field name or a SortBuilder must be passed.

h4. Returned sort values

The sort values are not part of the search results themselves but are part of @result.sort@.
@sort@ contains all search values calculated by the ElasticSearch server as a list mapped to the id of the respective domain objects

h4. Example
{code:groovy}
assert [1:[23, 42], 2: [24, 40]] == result.sort
{code}
