Elasticsearch can map field contents as dynamic objects.
This is especially useful if you store JSON Strings in your database and want to make those objects searchable in elasticsearch.

h4. Example

{code}
class Session {

    String jsonData

    static searchable = {
        dynamic: true
    }
}

Session session = new Session()
session.jsonData = ([foo: 'bar']Â as JSON).toString()

{code}

The default mapping would make the jsonData field an escaped String field and
a search for jsonData.foo = bar would result in no result.
With dynamic mapping enabled for this field, we enable JSON handling of this field and tell elasticsearch to map this field dynamicly.
The result is that a search for jsonData.foo=bar would result in a search hit.
Attention: This will only work on String fields and will result in an error if the String is no valid json
