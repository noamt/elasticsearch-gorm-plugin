Delete an index, all its mapping and its content from the ElasticSearch instance. Be careful when using this command because it cannot be undone.
Note that the generated mapping from the grails plugin is also deleted.

The method can be limited to one or more specific indices or applied to all indices at once (called with no parameter).

{code}
elasticSearchAdminService.deleteIndex()
{code}
